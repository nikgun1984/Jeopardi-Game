# Jeopardi-Game

The game features a quiz competition in which players are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, 
and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. Data is fetched from API-- http://jservice.io/. There is a way 
to start and restart your game. I used axios to request data from API, jQuery libraries, Twitter Bootstrap v4.5.2, fontawesome 
website.
